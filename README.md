# Huffman Encoding & Decoding 

Built in using HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT

Short description:
A Huffman code is a type of optimal prefix code that is used for compressing data. The Huffman encoding and decoding schema is also lossless, meaning that when compressing the data to make it smaller, there is no loss of information.
The Huffman algorithm works by assigning codes that correspond to the relative frequency of each character for each character. The Huffman code can be of any length and does not require a prefix; therefore, this binary code can be visualized on a binary tree with each encoded character being stored on leafs.

There are many different types of pseudocode for this tree, but at its basic core, 3 things have to be made:

1. Build a huffman tree
2. Encode the given data
3. Decode the data, with the encoded data and tree as an input

# Shannon-Fano Encoding & Decoding 
Short description:
Shannon Fano Algorithm is an entropy encoding technique for lossless data compression of multimedia. Named after Claude Shannon and Robert Fano, it assigns a code to each symbol based on their probabilities of occurrence. It is a variable-length encoding scheme, that is, the codes assigned to the symbols will be of varying lengths. 

1.Create a list of probabilities or frequency counts for the given set of symbols so that the relative frequency of occurrence of each symbol is known.
2.Sort the list of symbols in decreasing order of probability, the most probable ones to the left and the least probable ones to the right.<br>
3.Split the list into two parts, with the total probability of both parts being as close to each other as possible.<br>
4.Assign the value 0 to the left part and 1 to the right part.<br>
5.Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each part until all the symbols are split into individual subgroups.
